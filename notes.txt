Enemy Changes To Do:

enemy shoots when player in range
	enemy shoots with degree of inaccuracy
	enemy spawn areas
	enemies spawned by enemy spawn when spawn area in contact with player "spawning radius"
	enemies despawned when distance from player
	enemy idle movement
	enemy attack movement - basic follow (delayed)(slower)(stops when in "shooting range")

Useful Snippets to Integrate:

	SceneTree.call_group(String group, String method):
	Basically executes a method on all nodes of a particular group. Use get_tree() instead of SceneTree if unsure
		func _on_discovered(): # this is a purely illustrative function
			get_tree().call_group("enemies", "player_was_discovered")
		The above code calls the function player_was_discovered on every member of the group enemies.
  
	SceneTree.get_nodes_in_group(String group):
		Gets a full list of all nodes of a particular group. Use get_tree() instead of SceneTree if unsure
			var enemies = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("enemies")
		Above code gets the full list of enemies nodes

  func _exit_tree():
		Last method called before a node leaves the scene tree. Maybe useful for something idk.
