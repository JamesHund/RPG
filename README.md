*WARNING: SPAGHETTI CODE* 
This was my first ever large project, and as such I had no idea how to structure it sanely. Loads of cyclic dependencies and violations of OOP principles.

It is a 2D RPG/shooter made in the Godot game engine.

I intend this not to be some original masterpiece of a game, but a way to learn Godot engine and basics of game design.

Works with Godot version/s 3.1.x
